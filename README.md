# Sublime Emacs #

An implementation of keybindings and a few select packages to bring emacs in line with some hard earned sublime muscle memory. Implemented for OS X (since that's what I'm currently using).

This package was written to ease my transition into emacs after trying and failing serveral times. This time emacs bends to *my* will.

Expect bugs.

TODO
-----
- M-l should square up selected region
- M-. Confilct with ispell
- mc/select-next-symbol-like-this breaks mark in evil normal
- m-/ toggle comment without selecting line (default binding for hippie-expand)
