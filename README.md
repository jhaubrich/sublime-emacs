# Sublime Emacs #

An implementation of keybindings and a few select packages to bring emacs in line with some hard earned sublime muscle memory. Implemented for OS X (since that's what I'm currently using).

This package was written to ease my transition into emacs after trying and failing serveral times. This time emacs bends to *my* will.

Expect bugs.
